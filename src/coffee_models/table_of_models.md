|Overall Goal/Focus | To evaluate the efficiency of the extraction process in espresso coffee by solving Advection–Diffusion–Reaction (ADR) equations using a polynomial-augmented Radial Basis Function (RBF) collocation method. The aim is to maximize beverage quality and minimize raw material usage. | To investigate the dynamics of liquid infiltration into an initially dry espresso bed, a stage typically neglected in previous models, by combining time-resolved x-ray tomography with a one-dimensional unsaturated porous medium flow model. | To elucidate the basic physics of coffee brewing using a simple base model, introduce reduced variables and the concept of bed extraction efficiency, and propose a new brewing control chart that connects actual brewing conditions to yield and strength. | To incorporate a particle-level swelling model into a one-dimensional coarse-grained extraction model to investigate the effects of swelling on extraction kinetics, with the ultimate goal of predicting extraction profiles and guiding espresso machine design and production. | To formulate a comprehensive and experimentally validated model for the physics of coffee extraction, including dissolution and transport processes within a coffee bed, and apply it to well-stirred dilute suspensions and packed coffee beds. | To quantify and analyze the uniformity of extraction within porous coffee beds, leveraging computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods, and to highlight the importance of this factor for coffee quality, which is often neglected in standard brewing charts. | 
| Brewing Process Stages Modeled | Focuses on the "extraction phase," assuming initial imbibition is discarded and grains are already wet. | Concentrates on the initial "infiltration stage," breaking it down into pre-ponding, post-ponding, and post-saturation phases where water permeates the initially dry bed. | Assumes the coffee bed and grains are initially wetted at t=0, thus the initial imbibition phase is not explicitly modeled. It discusses the "early time high fluxes". | Assumes the entire coffee bed is initially surrounded by water with diffusion and convection starting simultaneously. However, the model can be modified to consider the "initial filling process" where water infuses from the top. | Focuses on the "steady state stage" where the bed is saturated and water enters and leaves at the same rate, neglecting the initial "filling" and final "draining" stages. Assumes grains are saturated initially. | Assumes particles are initially wet and all soluble coffee is dissolved in the intragranular pore space. Focuses on steady-state flow conditions. | 
| Spatial Dimensions | Uses a uni-dimensional model for the liquid phase (vertical direction) and a uni-dimensional model for the solid phase (radial direction within each grain). The meshless method allows for easy generalization to higher dimensions or more complex domains. | Employs a one-dimensional (1D) model for unsaturated porous medium flow, assuming a uniform, flat, and sharp wetting front. | The bed is divided into N layers, effectively treating the problem as one-dimensional along the axial direction (flow direction). | Utilizes a one-dimensional (1D) coarse-grained extraction model for the coffee bed, divided into layers. | Develops macroscopic balance equations that are general, but for simulations, they are reduced to a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for batch brewing (well-mixed) and a one-dimensional (1D) partial differential equation (PDE) for cylindrical brewing chambers. | Uses a two-dimensional (2D) axisymmetric model for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. Also employs one-dimensional (1D) models for cylindrical and truncated cone geometries for comparison. | 
| Flow Model | Describes mass transport and dissolution using Advection–Diffusion–Reaction (ADR) equations. Incorporates Darcy lux (q) as a parameter representing flow. | Models water permeation through the bed as unsaturated porous medium flow. Darcy's law is applied to describe flow in the wet region behind the wetting front. The model also incorporates espresso pump dynamics. | Assumes a constant volumetric flow rate Q(t) for simulations. The pressure gradient is understood to set the flow rate through Darcy's law, but pressure is not directly included as a relevant variable in the base model. | Can operate under two conditions: either the superficial flow velocity (q) is fixed, or the pressure drop (Δp) across the bed is fixed. Darcy's law is used to determine q when Δp is fixed, with hydrodynamic conductivity calculated via the Carman-Kozeny relation. | Models fluid flow within the coffee bed as through a static, saturated porous medium, driven by a pressure gradient. Darcy's Law is used to relate flow to the pressure gradient, and the Kozeny–Carman equation estimates permeability. | Solves fluid flow using the Navier-Stokes equations, specifically the Euler-Euler multiphase flow model, within ANSYS Fluent. The Gidaspow model is used for drag force interaction from the solid granular phase. For 1D models, Darcy's law is applied. | 
| Coffee Bed Structure | Approximates coffee powder as spheres of two distinct radii: fines (a_f) and boulders (a_b). φ represents the local volume fraction occupied by grains, which is a sum of volume fractions for fines (φ_f) and boulders (φ_b). | Describes the coffee bed as a "dual porosity medium," distinguishing between intergranular pores (between grains) and intragranular pores (within grains). The total water-accessible porosity (φ_T) is a key parameter. The total bed volume is assumed fixed. | Characterizes the coffee as a packed bed of particles. The bed porosity (ε_bed) is a parameter that is studied for its sensitivity, acknowledging that it likely varies during brewing. Mentions the heterogeneous internal structure of coffee grains. | Assumes a fixed total volume for the coffee bed, meaning that particle swelling only alters the porosity of the bed but not its height. Initial bed porosity (ε_0b) and particle porosity (ε_p) are specified. | Uses a "double porosity model" where the coffee bed consists of intergranular pores (h-phase) and intragranular pores (v-phase), in addition to the solid coffee matrix (s-phase). The intergranular porosity (φ_h) is assumed constant. | Models the coffee as a packed granular bed where the solid velocity is zero and the volume fraction of the solid (α_s) remains constant. Assumes the bed is sufficiently packed with no grain movement or stress build-up. Liquid volume fraction is assumed constant. | 
| Particle Size Distribution (PSD) Representation | PSD is described as bimodal based on laser diffraction granulometry, which justifies the choice of considering two families of particles: fines (diameter ≤ 100 μm) and boulders (diameter ≥ 100 μm). | PSD is typically simplified as bimodal, with large grains (100–1000 μm) and small grains (10–100 μm). | PSD is described as bimodal, with fine and coarse distributions. The model approximates this to just three parameters: representative fine and coarse particle sizes and the volume fraction of fines. Particles are assumed spherical. | Uses four types of coffee powder with measured particle size distributions (bimodal). Approximates PSD by classifying particles as fines (<100 μm) and coarses (>100 μm), determining their volume fractions and representative radii (R_f, R_c), and using Sauter mean diameter (d). | Characterizes PSD as bimodal, having two peaks (e.g., at 25-30 μm and a larger size). Uses two separate Sauter mean diameters (ksv1 for entire distribution, ksv2 for particles above 50 μm representing kernels). | Acknowledges bimodal distribution as typical for ground coffee. The model incorporates two representative grain sizes, denoted as small (ds1) and large (ds2), corresponding to the fine and coarse peaks in the PSD. Assumes spherical grains. | 
| Solute Representation | Assumes a "common behavior for different chemical substances" for simplicity, representing them as liquid phase concentration (c_l) and solid concentrations (c_f, c_b). The model can be generalized to deal with multiple chemical species. | Treats "coffee" as if it were a single substance, simplifying the models by focusing on mass concentration. | Models extraction for a "single diffusing species" initially, but notes it's straightforward to generalize to multiple species by rescaling time and superimposing. Also considers two diffusing species with different diffusion constants and mass distributions to fit experimental data. | Treats "all the soluble solids as a single component" with a lumped partition coefficient (K). | Models coffee as a "single entity" (coffee concentration or brew strength), justifying this by the similar extraction kinetics of many important coffee components and the widespread use of single-component quality measures. | Assumes a "single soluble coffee component" for simplicity in the extraction model. |
| Extraction Mechanism/Kinetics | Describes transport of chemicals from grain interior to surface, their dissolution into the liquid, and transport due to fluid flow. Incorporates "reactive terms" (G_f, G_b) that link liquid and solid species dynamics, involving a non-linear reaction rate (k_r). Diffusion equation in spherical coordinates models intra-grain transport. | While acknowledging soluble content is extracted, the model primarily tracks the infiltration of water and the saturation of the bed, rather than the detailed kinetics of solute dissolution itself. | Models diffusion of soluble species out of particles into the bed pore space. The concentration in the pore space acts as a changing boundary condition for diffusion within the particles. The concept of "bed extraction efficiency" (~g) describes the rate of species removal from the bed. | Models the diffusion of soluble solids (c) inside the grain, coupled with the diffusion of "additional water" (c_w) which drives swelling. The flux (j(r)) out of the particle acts as a source term for the bed-level diffusion-convection equation. | Models extraction using two mechanisms: an initial "rapid extraction" from damaged cells on the grain surface and fines, and a "slower extraction" from intact cells in the grain kernel. This involves solid-fluid mass transfer terms where the solid matrix itself is dissolving, with a thin saturated liquid layer at c_sat. Uses first-order rate equations for ψs and ψv (fractions of soluble coffee left). | Models the transfer of soluble coffee from the coffee grinds to the water using first-order rate kinetics for the concentrations in the liquid (cl) and solid (cs) phases. It incorporates a mass transfer coefficient (hsl) and effective mass diffusivity (Dv). | 
| Swelling Effects | Not explicitly mentioned or modeled. However, porosity (φ) is a key parameter that influences the dynamics. | Acknowledges that coffee particles may swell (e.g., 15% increase in size within 30 seconds). However, the current model does not directly incorporate swelling effects, noting it as a potential area for future work. | Assumes swelling of grains is absent in the base model. However, it notes that porosity varies during wetting and brewing due to several effects, including "possible swelling of the grains dependent on water quality". | A particle-level swelling model is incorporated, where swelling is treated as a water diffusion process into the grain, leading to a concomitant geometric expansion. This swelling affects both intra-granular diffusion and inter-granular convection. | Not explicitly modeled. It is assumed that any swelling of coffee grains would occur during the initial filling stage and would manifest itself in the steady-state stage possibly as a slight shift in the grind size distribution. | Not modeled. However, the paper acknowledges other factors that could cause flow inhomogeneity, such as microstructure changes due to swelling. | 
| Erosion/Particle Migration | Not explicitly mentioned as modeled. | Acknowledges "flow-induced mechanical erosion" and "fines migration" as topics of previous research and potential explanations for observed phenomena, but these are not directly incorporated into the proposed model. | Not explicitly mentioned as modeled. The paper focuses on diffusion and flow. | Acknowledges "particle migration," "erosion," and "consolidation" as factors that can affect the coffee matrix and extraction kinetics. However, the model completely neglects the erosion process. | Not explicitly mentioned as modeled. | Not explicitly modeled. However, the paper notes that agglomeration of fine particles could lead to non-uniform extraction. | 
| Temperature Effects | Water temperature (T) is a variable considered in laboratory tests used for comparison. However, the model's physico-chemical parameters (e.g., diffusivities, reaction rate) are given fixed values for numerical experiments, implying temperature effects are accounted for in these constants rather than dynamically modeled. | Mentions typical hot water temperatures for espresso brewing (92°C–95°C). The high temperature of incoming water is assumed to instantaneously increase the temperature of the trapped gas volume (T1), which affects initial headspace pressure. It notes that the influence of water temperature on coffee flow and absorption into individual grains is not well understood. | Mentions that maximal yield and the kinetics of brewing vary with temperature, beyond just the temperature scaling of diffusion constants. Experiments for comparison were conducted with liquid temperatures of 80–90°C. | Mentions typical espresso water temperatures (90 ± 5°C) and sets the temperature immediately after the heating element at 98°C for experiments. The diffusion coefficient of caffeine in water is given at 80°C. Temperature effects on swelling are mentioned as a potential factor for baristas. | States that coffee extraction experiments were conducted with hot water at 90°C. The diffusion coefficient used (Dh, Dv) is for caffeine in water at 80°C, acknowledging it would be slightly higher at 90°C. The model is presented for isothermal conditions, with future work potentially including heat transfers. | States that water was heated up to 90°C for experiments. The model itself does not explicitly incorporate temperature as a variable that changes diffusion coefficients or other parameters dynamically. | 
| Pressure/Pump Dynamics | Water pressure (p) is a variable in the laboratory tests used for model validation. The Darcy lux (q), representing the volumetric flow rate, is a key parameter in the model's equations, which is computed from laboratory measurements. | The model explicitly incorporates espresso pump dynamics. It describes the pump's delivery of water in response to pressure drops (e.g., pp - ph = Rf Q). It also models the build-up of liquid and gas pressure in the headspace, assuming the trapped air obeys the ideal gas law. Capillary suction pressure (pc) at the wetting front is included. | The base model assumes flow is driven by a pressure gradient (via Darcy's law) but does not include brewing pressure as a directly relevant variable other than through its influence on flow rate. Experiments for comparison involved applying a fixed overpressure to drive flow. The model can be coupled to a "brewer model" to include realistic pump behavior and pressure coupling. | The model can be run with either a fixed superficial flow velocity (q) or a fixed pressure drop (Δp) across the coffee bed. In experiments with a prototype machine, the nominal pressure (e.g., 4, 9, or 15 bar) was varied. | The model assumes flow is driven by a pressure gradient, which can be mechanically applied (as in an espresso machine) or hydrostatic (as in a drip filter). The cylindrical brewing chamber can operate in either a constant flow or a fixed pressure differential mode. It assumes the pressure in intergranular pores is greater than or equal to the pressure in intragranular pores. | For experiments, a constant flow rate of 250 ml/min was selected. The CFD model uses a pressure outlet boundary condition. For the 1D models, fixed pressure or fixed volumetric flux conditions can be applied at the inlet. The model assumes no stress build-up or compression of the solid phase due to pressure. | 
| Numerical Methods | Employs a polynomial-augmented Radial Basis Function (RBF) collocation method with polyharmonic splines to solve the ADR equations. A modified Crank–Nicolson method is used for time discretization, and a nested fixed-point iteration algorithm solves the resulting system. It is a meshless method. | The dimensionless model's ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are solved numerically using MATLAB's inbuilt ODE solver ode23s. Parameter fitting (for K, φ_T, and t_shift) is carried out by minimizing an objective function using MATLAB's fmincon function. | The equations are implemented in the scripting language Scilab using bespoke code. A finite difference form is used for convection. An explicit scheme is employed to solve the diffusion equation within particles, and profiles are iterated inside particles. | Uses a finite difference method to solve the coupled particle-level (swelling and diffusion) and bed-level (diffusion-convection) equations. Specifically, Crank-Nicolson is used for particle-level dynamics, while Euler or Predictor-Corrector methods are used for bed-level evolution. | Numerical simulations are conducted in MATLAB. For batch-wise brewing, a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is solved. For the cylindrical brewing chamber, a reduced set of partial differential equations (PDEs) is solved using finite differences in the spatial direction and the method of lines. | Solves fluid flow using ANSYS Fluent (commercial CFD software). It employs a transient implicit time-stepping method with the SIMPLE (Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure-Lined Equations) pressure-velocity coupling scheme. The 1D models are implemented numerically in MATLAB, using the method of lines with first-order backward differences and ode23s for time integration. | 
| Validation Method | Numerical results for Extraction Yield (EY) are compared to laboratory measurements performed under various conditions of water pressure, temperature, and granulometry. | Model predictions are validated by comparison with time-resolved x-ray tomography data, which is used to track the wetting front (s(t)) and the height of water ponding (H(t)). Experiments were conducted using a modified Delonghi espresso machine. | Model predictions (total mass concentration) are compared against experimental results obtained from a custom-built brewing rig that applies a constant hydrodynamic pressure to a coffee bed. The paper also discusses consistency with "optimal espresso practice". | Simulation results for extraction yield and strength are compared with experimental data obtained from a prototype espresso machine capable of fixed flow rate control. The partition coefficient (K) is tuned to achieve the best match with experimental data. | The model is experimentally validated by comparing its quantitative predictions to two sets of experimental data: batch-wise brewing in a fixed water volume (French press type) and extraction profiles from a cylindrical brewing chamber using a rotary vane pump. | Model results (from both CFD and 1D models) are compared to experimental data obtained from a cylindrical brewing chamber. The impact of non-uniform flow on extraction uniformity is visualized using "extraction maps" and quantified on the industry-standard coffee brewing control chart. |
